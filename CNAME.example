# CNAME File for Custom Domain
# If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., www.autohub.com), rename this file to "CNAME"
# and add your domain below.

# Example: www.autohub.com
# or: autohub.com

# Note: GitHub Pages will use this file to configure your custom domain.
# Make sure your DNS settings are properly configured after renaming this file.
